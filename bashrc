# unga bunga mode
# monk mode

# - the actions that you take create the life that you live
# - change your actions, change your life
# - be aware
# - notice yourself going into auto-pilot mode, become aware
# - Discipline and awareness are the same
# - get used to being bored
# - your brain will try to get you to fallback on the same destructive habits as always. Simply notice this, be aware of it, and push back. You are in a control. The brain can win this fight. It can only persuade you to give up. As long as you don't relinquish control, as long  as you are aware, you can.
# - Dedicate your actions fully to the betterment of your life, to the development of your soul and to the nourishment of your spirit. Accept that this will not benefit you in the moment, it will be hard, it will be tiring, it will not feel good. Do it anyway.
# - Be in the here and now, always.

# -  Eat healthy
# -  Workout
# - Study
# - Work
# - Meditate
# - Read
# - Be bored

# Do this for as long as it takes.
# Your brain will try to get you stop, asking "How long must I do this for?". That is not the point. You will know when it is enough. Don't worry about the finish line. Just do it. For as long as it needs to be done.

# Remember, you hold the keys. You can do whatever you want. Your destiny is not set in stone. You choose who you become. You have never existed before. You are you, no one else. No one knows how your story goes, no one decides that except you.
